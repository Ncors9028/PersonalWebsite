    <h2> How They Have Changed My Life </h2>
    
    <ul2>
      <li> My Dad - My dad has always been there for through thick and thin and has always stuck with me no matter the mistakes ive made or problems ive caused and I couldnt ask for a btter father in my life becasue I know there arent many dads out there that would do things my dad has done for me.</li>
      <li> My Stepmom - My Stepmom is the most inspring person in my life she has done so much for me and brought me up when ever I felt down and I could not ask for a better Mom in my life although sometimes she can be annoying I still love her and no matter what I alwasy will</li>
      <li> My Brothers - staring off with my brother Jeff he was alwasy that one person in my life who never gave up on me and always believed in my dreasm no matter hard and alwsy pushed me to my greatest strengths although he had left this world way too early i still know he would want me to continue with my dreams. My Brother Hons has always pushed me until I collapsed literally and if anyone has wanted me to be better than them it is him becasue sometimes I forget to listen and makes sure I understand what hes syaing before he moves onto something else.</li>
      <li> My Grandma - My Grandma has been the one person on my moms side of the family that never really evcer gave up on me no matter how hard or tough things got she was alwys there for em and anything I ever needed she was there for me whether it was money or just to hnagout she was always rigt there waiting for me.</li>
